# CTF Writeups

⚠️**Disclaimer**⚠️:  
- All information presented here is for educational purposes. I am not responsible for the use or damage it may cause.
- I am only a guy who has participated in some CTFs of different platforms. I am fully grateful to them to allow anyone can learn and practice for free.
- I don't have any relationship with the platforms where I have participated, other than as a player of the free CTFs events.
- I share the content once the events are finalized (Probably with a delay while I prepare the documentation).

This repository will store write-ups from some CTF in which I have participated.

The directory structure follows this rule:

```
{Year}-{Plataform}-{CTF Name}
```

So I hope you enjoy it and you could clarify your doubts and learn. 


> Do it for the pleasure of challenging yourself.
