## [Wrong Spooky Season](./1-Wrong-Spooky-Season.md)

"I told them it was too soon and in the wrong season to deploy such a website, but they assured me that theming it properly would be enough to stop the ghosts from haunting us. I was wrong." Now there is an internal breach in the `Spooky Network` and you need to find out what happened. Analyze the the network traffic and find how the scary ghosts got in and what they did.

## [Trick or Breach](./2-Trick-or-Breach.md)

Our company has been working on a secret project for almost a year. None knows about the subject, although rumor is that it is about an old Halloween legend where an old witch in the woods invented a potion to bring pumpkins to life, but in a more up-to-date approach. Unfortunately, we learned that malicious actors accessed our network in a massive cyber attack. Our security team found that the hack had occurred when a group of children came into the office's security external room for trick or treat. One of the children was found to be a paid actor and managed to insert a USB into one of the security personnel's computers, which allowed the hackers to gain access to the company's systems. We only have a network capture during the time of the incident. Can you find out if they stole the secret project?

## [Halloween Invitation](./3-Halloween-Invitation.md)

An email notification pops up. It's from your theater group. Someone decided to throw a party. The invitation looks awesome, but there is something suspicious about this document. Maybe you should take a look before you rent your banana costume.

## [POOF](./4-POOF.md)

In my company, we are developing a new python game for Halloween. I'm the leader of this project; thus, I want it to be unique. So I researched the most cutting-edge python libraries for game development until I stumbled upon a private game-dev discord server. One member suggested I try a new python library that provides enhanced game development capabilities. I was excited about it until I tried it. Quite simply, all my files are encrypted now. Thankfully I manage to capture the memory and the network traffic of my Linux server during the incident. Can you analyze it and help me recover my files? To get the flag, connect to the docker service and answer the questions.
==WARNING! Do not try to run the malware on your host. It may harm your computer! ==

## [Downgrade](./5-Downgrade.md)

During recent auditing, we noticed that network authentication is not forced upon remote connections to our Windows 2012 server. That led us to investigate our system for suspicious logins further. Provided the server's event logs, can you find any suspicious successful login?
